# Gravity-Simulation

Small program to simulate gravity under Newton's laws of Gravitation using Euler's method
This was implemented in python with the module pygame.
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2) and works by cycling through each body and working out the forces affecting it
The program is fairly unoptimised - further improvements could involve adding a quadtree or moving to a faster language.
